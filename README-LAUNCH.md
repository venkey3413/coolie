# Paradise Resort - Easy Launch Guide

## 🚀 Quick Start (Local Development)

### Option 1: Windows (Easiest)
```bash
# Double-click this file:
start-local.bat
```

### Option 2: Command Line
```bash
# Start local server
python -m http.server 3000
# Then open: http://localhost:3000
```

### Option 3: Using npm
```bash
npm start
```

## ☁️ Deploy to AWS S3 (Production)

### Prerequisites
1. Install AWS CLI: https://aws.amazon.com/cli/
2. Configure AWS credentials:
   ```bash
   aws configure
   ```

### Deploy
```bash
# Make script executable (Linux/Mac)
chmod +x deploy-fixed.sh

# Run deployment
./deploy-fixed.sh
```

## 🔧 Code Issues Found & Fixed

### High Priority Issues:
- ✅ **Fixed carriage returns** in deploy.sh (caused script failures)
- ⚠️ **Missing authorization** in JavaScript forms (for production, add backend validation)
- ⚠️ **Alert boxes** in JavaScript (replace with proper notifications for production)

### Medium Priority Issues:
- ✅ **Performance optimizations** needed (cache DOM queries)
- ✅ **Duplicate code** in room price calculations

### Recommendations for Production:
1. Add backend API for form submissions
2. Implement proper user authentication
3. Replace alert() with toast notifications
4. Add input validation and sanitization
5. Use HTTPS (CloudFront + SSL certificate)
